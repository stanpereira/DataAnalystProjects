# Bank Loan Case Study

## Project Description
The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer will have difficulty paying their installments. 

This information can be used to make decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. 

The company wants to understand the key factors behind loan default so it can make better decisions about loan approval.

## Approach
-	Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately
-	Identify Outliers in the Dataset
-	Analyze Data Imbalance
-	Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis
-	Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios

## Tech-Stack Used
Microsoft Excel 365 Free

## Insights 
1. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately: Identify the missing data in the dataset using Excel built-in functions and features.
2. Identify Outliers in the Dataset: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.
3. Analyze Data Imbalance: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.
4. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: 
  - Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables,
  - Segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and 
  - Bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.
5. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.

## Project Impact 
This project involved an extensive use of Excel and Statistics. It was an enormous challenge trying to work in Excel and manipulate such massive data.

Nonetheless, the project was very insightful and informative. It allowed me to learn to work with such datasets.

Throughout the project, I got a deeper understanding on EDA, right from analysing the data columns, to handling missing data and creating new analysis. I was also able to learn about new add-ins in Excel such as Data Analyzer.
