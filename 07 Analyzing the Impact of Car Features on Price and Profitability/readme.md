## Project Description
The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to consumers.

For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked, “How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?

This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.

## Approach
-	Understand the data – Understand the dataset, features and impact on other columns.
-	Clean the data - Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately.
-	Analyze Data – Analyze the data to find various relationships between features to derive conclusions.
-	Visualization – Visualize the data using Tables, Charts and Dashboards.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

The dataset contains information on over 11,000 car models and their specifications, including details on the car's make, model, year, fuel type, engine power, transmission, wheels, number of doors, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon, popularity, and manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).

This dataset could be useful for a variety of data analysis tasks, such as:
-	Exploring trends in car features and pricing over time
-	Comparing the fuel efficiency of different types of cars
-	Investigating the relationship between a car's features and its popularity
-	Predicting the price of a car based on its features and market category

However, it's important to note that the dataset was last updated in 2017, so it may not reflect current trends or prices in the automotive industry.

## Tech-Stack Used
Microsoft Excel 2010 Version 14.0.7628.5000

## Analysis 
You need to build an interactive dashboard in Excel from the tasks given below:
1. How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?
2. What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?
3. Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?
4. How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?
5. What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?

## Building the Dashboard
The client has requested these questions given below:
1. How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?
2. Which car brands have the highest and lowest average MSRPs, and how does this vary by body style?
3. How do the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP, and how does this vary by body style?
4. How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across different body styles and model years?
5. How does the car's horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different Brands?

## Project Impact
This particular project involved an extensive usage of Excel and Statistics. 

Most of the analysis was done by using Pivot Tables and Charts, for which a lot of research was done. 

Creating a dashboard was a new and interesting challenge, which was challenging, and could have been easily done using PowerBI or Tableau. (I am thinking of redoing just the dashboard in Tableau)

In Statistics, achieving the Regression Analysis for many columns together was difficult, but after researching it, was able to understand and complete the task.

The major challenge faced was in understanding the data. Updating the NULL/Missing values proved a challenge as most of the data required internet research. There were some data irregularities, which were dealt with.

_**Overall, this was a very challenging but creative and informative project.**_
