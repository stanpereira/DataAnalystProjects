This folder contains a list of Data Analyst Projects done as assignments using SQL and Excel. A brief of the projects are mentioned below :

1. Data Analytics Process : This is a case study on an example of how ${\textbf{\color{red} Data Analytics}}$ is used in a ${\textbf{\color{red} Real Life Scenario}}$.

2. Instagram User Analytics : The project showcases the ${\textbf{\color{red} use of SQL Statements}}$ to analyse and attain results for visualisation.\

It includes ${\textbf{\color{red} importing csv files}}$ to MySQL, using ${\textbf{\color{red} sql statements}}$ to answer questions, and then use the results in ${\textbf{\color{red} Excel}}$ for _**analysis and visualisation**_.\
   _**(Tools Used : MySQL and MS Excel)**_

4. Hiring Process Analytics - The goal of this project to use ${\textbf{\color{red} Statistics}}$ and ${\textbf{\color{red} Excel}}$ for Analysis and Visualisation. This project also allows me to improve on the ${\textbf{\color{red} Exploratory Data Analysis}}$ (EDA) process of _**cleaning data, handling outliers, preparing data for analysis, calculating statistical measures and data visualisation.**_\
   _**(Tools Used : MS Excel)**_

5. IMDB Movie Analysis - The goal of a Data Analyst is not just to answer questions, but provide ${\textbf{\color{red} insights for decision making}}$. This project, alongwith the EDA process, deals with asking the ${\textbf{\color{red} 5 "Whys" and Story Preparation}}$, so as to make the findings more understandable.\
