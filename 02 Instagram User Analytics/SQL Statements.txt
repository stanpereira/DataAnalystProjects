(select username from users left join photos on users.id=photos.user_id where photos.id is null
[
select u.id,u.username,count(p.user_id) as 'no. of posts' from users u left join photos p on u.id = p.user_id group by u.id having count(p.user_id)=0
]


Contest Winner Declaration: The team has organized a contest where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins.
Your Task: Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.(RANK)
{select likes.photo_id, users.username, count(likes.user_id) as nooflikes from likes inner join photos on likes.photo_id = photos.id inner join users on photos.user_id=users.id group by likes.photo_id,users.username order by nooflikes desc}

(select username, photos.id, photos.image_url, count(likes.user_id) as total from photos inner join users on photos.user_id = users.id group by photos.id order by total desc limit 1)

[
select id,username from users where id=(select user_id from photos where id=(select photo_id from likes group by photo_id order by count(photo_id) desc limit 1))
]


Hashtag Research: A partner brand wants to know the most popular hashtags to use in their posts to reach the most people.
Your Task: Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform. (RANK)
{
select t.tag_name,count(p.photo_id) as ht from photo_tags p inner join tags t on t.id=p.tag_id group by t.tag_name order by ht desc
}

(select tags.tag_name, count(*) as total from photo_tags join tags on photo_tags.tag_id=tags.id group by tags.id order by total DESC limit 5)

[
select t.tag_name,count(t.tag_name) as "tags count" from tags t inner join photo_tags ph on t.id = ph.tag_id group by t.tag_name order by count(t.tag_name) DESC limit 5
]

Ad Campaign Launch: The team wants to know the best day of the week to launch ads.
Your Task: Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.

select DATE_FORMAT((created_at),'%d') as d, count(username) from users group by 1 order by 2 desc
}

(select DAYNAME(created_at) AS day, count(*) as total from users group by day order by total DESC limit 1)

[
select dayname(Created_at) "day of week", count(dayname(Created_at)) "count of users registered" from users group by dayname(created_at) order by count(dayname(Created_at)) DESC limit 2
]


B) Investor Metrics:

User Engagement: Investors want to know if users are still active and posting on Instagram or if they are making fewer posts.
Your Task: Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.
{
with base as (select u.id as userid,count(p.id) as photoid from users u left join photos p on p.user_id=u.id) 
select sum(photoid) as total photos, count(userid) as total_users, sum(photoid/count(userid) as photoperuser from base
}

select (select count(*) from photos)/(select count(*) from users) as avg

[
select (select count(id) from photos)/select count(distinct user_id) from photos) as Average_posts_per_user, (select count(id) from photos) / select count(id) from users) as Ratio_of_total_posts_to_total_users
]

Bots & Fake Accounts: Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.
Your Task: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.
{
with base as (select u.username,count(l.photo_id) as likess from likes l inner join users u on u.id=l.user_id group by u.username)
select username,likess from base where likess=(select count(*) from photos) order by username
}

(select user_id, count(*) as num_likes from likes group by user_id having num_likes = (select count(*) from photos)
(select u.username,count(*) as num_likes from users u join likes l on u.id = l.user_id group by u.id having num_likes = (select count (*) from photos)

[
select id,username from users where id in (select user_id from likes group by  user_id having count(user id) = (select count(id) from photos))
]
